The equation studied:
$$-(-\Delta)^s u = u_+^\gamma - u_-^\gamma \quad\text{in } B_1,\qquad \gamma\in(0,\tfrac13),\ s\in(\tfrac12,1).$$

## Lesson 1 — Orientation

**Physical picture (dead cores).** A reactant diffuses into a catalyst pellet and is consumed by a reaction of order $\gamma<1$. If the reaction is fast, the reactant is used up before reaching the center, leaving a region where the concentration is *exactly* zero — the **dead core**. The sublinear, non-Lipschitz term $u^\gamma$ (with $0<\gamma<1$) is precisely what lets $u$ reach zero on a whole set rather than at isolated points.

**The equation, unpacked.**
- $(-\Delta)^s$ = fractional Laplacian: *nonlocal* diffusion. It averages differences $u(x)-u(y)$ over **all** of $\mathbb{R}^n$, weighted by $|x-y|^{-n-2s}$. Far-away values influence $x$ — the root of every technical difficulty.
- **Two-phase**: $u$ has no fixed sign. RHS is $u_+^\gamma$ where $u>0$, $-u_-^\gamma$ where $u<0$. The set where $u$ vanishes with derivatives = **branching points** (the free-boundary analogue).
- $\gamma\in(0,1/3)$, $s\in(1/2,1)$: forced by the method. $\gamma<1/3 \iff \gamma<\frac{1}{1+2s}$ is the integrability condition that makes a key increment lie in the tail space $L^1_s$.

**Main result (eq. 1.2).** At a branching point $x_0$:
$$|u(x)| \le C\,|x-x_0|^{\frac{2s}{1-\gamma}}.$$
"Improved" because the exponent $\frac{2s}{1-\gamma} > 2s+\gamma$ beats the Schauder ceiling $C^{2s+\gamma}$.

**Strategy (the whole paper in 4 moves).**
1. **Scale** around the branching point: $v_r(x)=u(rx)/r^{2s/(1-\gamma)}$, study $r\to0$.
2. **Pass to the limit** $v_r\to v_0$; the reaction term dies in the limit, leaving a clean equation.
3. **Liouville** (§3): the only such limit with the allowed growth is a polynomial of degree $\nu\in\{1,2\}$.
4. **Contradiction**: polynomial structure forces the sharp growth (1.2).

This skeleton — *scale → limit → Liouville → contradict* — is reused by Correa–dos Prazeres for the $p$-Laplacian and is what our project ports.

## Lesson 2 — The grammar of §2 (spaces, solutions, regularity toolbox)

**1. The fractional Laplacian.**
$$(-\Delta)^s u(x) = c_{n,s}\,\mathrm{P.V.}\!\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}\frac{u(x)-u(y)}{|x-y|^{n+2s}}\,dy.$$
- **P.V.**: the weight $|x-y|^{-n-2s}$ is non-integrable near $y=x$; symmetric cancellation of the odd part of $u(x)-u(y)$ makes the limit finite. Needs $u$ locally $C^{1,1}$/$C^2$ at $x$ for the classical value — motivates viscosity solutions.
- **Scaling (memorize):** $(-\Delta)^s[u(\lambda\cdot)](x)=\lambda^{2s}\,((-\Delta)^su)(\lambda x)$ — order-$2s$ derivative. This dictates the $r^{2s/(1-\gamma)}$ normalization in §4.
- $c_{n,s}$: normalization, depends only on $n,s$; ensures $(-\Delta)^s\to-\Delta$ as $s\to1$ (used in §5).

**2. Tail space $L^1_s$.** $\displaystyle\|u\|_{L^1_s}=\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}\frac{|u(y)|}{1+|y|^{n+2s}}\,dy.$ Finiteness $\iff$ the far-field tail is tame enough for nonlocal diffusion to be defined/stable. **Every difficulty (the §4 gap, the $p$-port) reduces to whether a rescaled function stays in (the analogue of) $L^1_s$.**

**3. Viscosity solutions (Def. 2.1).** Touching-test-function notion: $u$ is a subsolution if wherever smooth $\varphi$ touches $u$ from above at $x_0$, the operator inequality holds for $v=\varphi$ (in small ball) $\cup\ u$ (outside). Chosen because (i) never differentiates $u$ directly, (ii) supports comparison/existence, (iii) generalizes to fully nonlinear / $p$-Laplacian. Note $v$ keeps real $u$ outside the ball — nonlocality built in.

**4. Comparison principle (Thm 2.1).** $Lu_1\le0\le Lu_2$ in $B_1$ and $u_1\ge u_2$ *outside* $B_1$ $\Rightarrow u_1\ge u_2$ everywhere. Ordering on the complement (not boundary) controls the inside; powers Perron existence.

**5. Hölder seminorms.** $[u]_{C^\alpha}=\sup\frac{|u(x)-u(y)|}{|x-y|^\alpha}$; $[u]_{C^{1+\alpha}}=\max_{|\beta|=1}[D^\beta u]_{C^\alpha}$; $[u]_{C^{2+\alpha}}$ likewise with $|\beta|=2$. §4's $\theta_k$ just tracks these under rescaling.

**6. Three regularity theorems (black boxes).**
- **Thm 2.2** (homogeneous): $(-\Delta)^su=0$, $\|u\|_{L^1_s}<\infty$ $\Rightarrow u\in C^{1+\sigma}(B_{1/2})$, $\|u\|_{C^{1+\sigma}(B_{1/2})}\le C(\|u\|_{L^\infty(B_1)}+\|u\|_{L^1_s})$. Tail term is the price of nonlocality. **Engine for the Liouville theorem.**
- **Thm 2.3** (bounded RHS): $-(-\Delta)^su=f\in L^\infty$, $s\in(1/2,1)$ $\Rightarrow u\in C^{1+\sigma}(B_{1/2})$, any $\sigma<2s-1$. *Why $s>1/2$:* need $2s-1>0$ to be in the differentiable regime. Baseline regularity.
- **Thm 2.4** (Schauder): $(-\Delta)^su\in C^\sigma \Rightarrow u\in C^{\sigma+2s}_{loc}$. With RHS $\in C^\gamma$ gives $u\in C^{2s+\gamma}_{loc}$ = the **Schauder ceiling** the main theorem beats.

Flow: 2.3 → differentiable regime; 2.4 → ceiling $C^{2s+\gamma}$; 2.2 → engine for Liouville. Main theorem beats the ceiling at branching points ($\frac{2s}{1-\gamma}$).

## Lesson 3 — The Liouville theorem (§3), the technical heart

**Liouville = "entire solution + controlled growth ⇒ polynomial."**

**Theorem 3.1.** If $s\in(1/2,1)$, $(-\Delta)^s(u(x+h)-u(x))=0$ in $B_1$ for all $h$ (3.1), and $[u]_{C^{\nu+\alpha}(B_R)}\le CR^{\beta-\alpha}$ for all $R\ge1$ with $0\le\alpha<\beta<1$, $\nu\in\{1,2\}$ (3.2), then $u$ is a degree-$\nu$ polynomial.

**Why the hypothesis is on increments (3.1), not on $u$:** that's the form the blow-up limit $v_0$ in §4 satisfies — $v_0$ isn't $s$-harmonic, but all its first differences are.

**Proof, $\nu=1$ (five moves):**
1. **Subtract the affine part** $w=u-u(0)-Du(0)\cdot x$. Legal because (a) increments of an affine function are constant in $x$ and $(-\Delta)^s(\text{const})=0$, so $w$ solves the same increment equation — *pure linearity, the move that dies for $p\ne2$*; (b) $[\cdot]_{C^{1+\alpha}}$ ignores affine parts so (3.2) is inherited. Now $w(0)=|Dw(0)|=0$.
2. **Differentiate + ride growth into the tail:** $w_e=Dw\cdot e$, $w_e(0)=0$ ⇒ $|w_e(x)|\le[w]_{C^{1,\alpha}(B_{|x|})}|x|^\alpha\le C|x|^\beta$ outside $B_1$. Since $\beta<1<2s$, $\int_{B_1^c}|w_e|/|y|^{n+2s}<\infty$ ⇒ **$w_e\in L^1_s$**. ($\beta<1$ is exactly what buys this.)
3. **Stability ⇒ $w_e$ is $s$-harmonic:** $w_e=\lim$ difference quotients of $w$, each $s$-harmonic; they converge in $L^1_s$ *globally*, so Caffarelli–Silvestre stability [11, Lem 5] passes the equation to the limit: $(-\Delta)^sw_e=0$ in $B_1$. **⚠️ This lemma needs GLOBAL $L^1_s$ convergence — here free, but in §4 it's exactly the gap.**
4. **Gradient-decay trick $\rho^{\beta-1}\to0$ (transplants to $p$!):** $v(x)=\rho^{-\beta}w_e(\rho x)$ has $\|v\|_{L^\infty(B_1)}\le C$ uniformly; Thm 2.2 ⇒ $\|Dv\|_{L^\infty(B_{1/2})}\le C$; but $=\rho^{1-\beta}\|Dw_e\|_{L^\infty(B_{1/2\rho})}$ ⇒ $\|Dw_e\|_{L^\infty(B_{1/2\rho})}\le\rho^{\beta-1}C_3\to0$. So $Dw_e(0)=0$; translation invariance ⇒ $Dw_e\equiv0$.
5. $w_e\equiv$ const $=0$ for every $e$ ⇒ $Dw\equiv0$ ⇒ $w\equiv0$ ⇒ $u$ affine. ∎

**$\nu=2$:** subtract quadratic Taylor poly, run the same machine on $w_{ee}$ ⇒ $u$ quadratic. (This is the case §4 uses, $\beta=\frac{2s}{1-\gamma}-2$.)

**Lemma 3.1 (jet-to-growth, mean value theorem only — transplants verbatim):** vanishing jet $u(0)=|D^{\nu-1}u(0)|=|D^\nu u(0)|=0$ + $\sup_{0<r<1/2}r^{\alpha-\beta}[u]_{C^{\nu+\alpha}(B_r)}\le A$ ($\beta>\alpha$) ⇒ $|u(x)|\le A|x|^{\nu+\beta}$ in $B_{1/2}$. Converts seminorm control + vanishing jet into pointwise growth; used in §4 to turn the contradiction hypothesis into Liouville's input.

**Carry-outs for the project:**
1. **Linearity used twice** (affine subtraction; derivative = limit of $s$-harmonic increments) — both fail for $p\ne2$ ⇒ must use Correa–dos Prazeres no-subtraction Liouville.
2. **Stability's global-$L^1_s$ hypothesis** = seed of the §4 gap.
3. **$\rho^{\beta-1}\to0$ decay trick survives** to the nonlinear/p setting.

## Lesson 4 — §4: the blow-up proof and the gap

Goal: Theorem 4.1, the sharp growth $|u(x)|\le C|x-x_0|^{\alpha}$, $\alpha=\frac{2s}{1-\gamma}$, at a **branching point** ($u(x_0)=|Du(x_0)|=0$). The whole proof is one **argument by contradiction**.

**Architecture (memorize this skeleton — the project reuses it verbatim):**
contradiction $\to$ $\theta_k$ device picks the right blow-up scale $\to$ compactness gives a limit $v_0$ $\to$ Liouville forces $v_0$ polynomial $\to$ vanishing jet kills it $\to$ contradicts the normalization.

**Step 1 — set up.** Normalize $x_0=0$, $\|u\|_\infty=1$. Baseline theory: $u\in C^{2s+\gamma}$ (the **Schauder ceiling**, best generic regularity). If the estimate fails, get solutions $u_k$, branching point $0$, uniform $[u_k]_{C^{2s+\gamma}}$, and points $x_k$ with $|u_k(x_k)|>k|x_k|^{\alpha}$ (4.3) — the violation grows with $k$.

**Step 2 — the $\theta_k$ device (the engine).**
$$\theta_k(r'):=\sup_{r'<r<1/2} r^{\,2s+\gamma-\alpha}\,[u_k]_{C^{2s+\gamma}(B_r)}\qquad(4.4).$$
The prefactor exponent $2s+\gamma-\alpha<0$ (since $\alpha>2s+\gamma$, "better than Schauder"). The violation (4.3) + jet-to-growth (Lemma 3.1) force $\lim_{r'\to0}\theta_k(r')>k$. *Why:* if $\theta_k$ stayed bounded, the seminorm would decay at the rate that **implies** the good growth $|u_k|\le C|x|^\alpha$, contradicting $x_k$.

**Step 3 — blow-up scale $r_k$.** Pick $r_k>\frac1k$ nearly achieving the sup: $r_k^{2s+\gamma-\alpha}[u_k]_{C^{2s+\gamma}(B_{r_k})}\ge\frac12\theta_k(r_k)$ and $\ge\frac1k\theta_k(1/k)\to\infty$. Forces $r_k\to0$ (zoom into the branching point).

**Step 4 — the blow-up $v_k$.** $v_k(x):=\dfrac{u_k(r_kx)}{\theta_k(r_k)\,r_k^{\alpha}}$ (4.6). Two normalizations chosen to hold together:
- **Seminorm bound (4.8):** $[v_k]_{C^{2s+\gamma}(B_R)}\le R^{\alpha-2s-\gamma}$, **only for $1\le R\le\frac{1}{2r_k}$** — flag this, it is the source of the gap.
- **Surviving normalization (4.10):** $[v_0]_{C^{2s+\gamma}(B_1)}\ge\frac12$ (limit is nontrivial).

The **anchor trick** ($\int\eta\,D_{ee}v_k=\int D_{ee}\eta\,v_k\le C_n$ pins a 2nd derivative at one point) + the seminorm bound give $|D_{ee}v_k|\le CR^{\alpha-2}$, hence **compactness**: $v_k\to v_0$ in $C^{2s+\gamma}_{loc}$.

**Step 5 — increments + the $\gamma<1/3$ condition.** Pass to increments $w^h=v_k(\cdot+h)-v_k$ (first differences, lower the order by one). Mean value theorem + (4.8): $|w^h(x)|\le C_h|x|^{\alpha-1}$ for $|x|\ge1$ (4.11). This is in the tail space $L^1_s$ **iff $\gamma<\frac{1}{1+2s}$** — implied by $\gamma<1/3$. **This is the entire reason for $\gamma<1/3$**: the integrability of the increment's tail. (= your project's tail condition C1.)

**Step 6 — limit passage (4.12) and THE GAP.** Since $u_k$ solves the equation,
$$-(-\Delta)^s\big(v_k(\cdot+h)-v_k\big)=(\text{prefactor}\to0)\cdot[\text{RHS difference}]\quad(4.12),$$
and PTU pass to the limit via the **stability lemma** (needs *global* $L^1_s$ convergence) to get $(-\Delta)^s(v_0(\cdot+h)-v_0)=0$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$. **The gap:** (4.11) holds only for $|x|\le\frac{1}{2r_k}$ (it rests on 4.8); beyond that $v_k$ is merely bounded by $2(\theta_k r_k^\alpha)^{-1}$, and the far-field tail contributes $\sim\theta_k^{-1}r_k^{-\frac{2s\gamma}{1-\gamma}}$, bounded only under a **lower bound on $\theta_k$** that (4.5) does not supply. CS Remark 4.4 shows the global hypothesis cannot be weakened ⇒ genuine question for R.T. (your (c′) repair fixes it by **truncating** at $\rho_k=\frac{1}{4r_k}$).

**Step 7 — Liouville finishes.** $v_0$ satisfies the increment-form hypothesis (3.1) with $\nu=2$ (vanishing 2-jet at the branching point), growth $\beta=\alpha-2<1$. Theorem 3.1 ⇒ $v_0$ is a degree-$\le2$ polynomial; vanishing 2-jet ⇒ $v_0\equiv0$, contradicting (4.10). ∎

**Carry-outs:**
1. Skeleton is reused in the project: swap $C^{2s+\gamma}\to C^{1,\alpha_0}$, linearity $\to$ homogeneity.
2. $\gamma<1/3$ = the $L^1_s$ integrability of the increment = tail condition **C1**.
3. The gap is at (4.12); the far-field needs a $\theta_k$ lower bound the device doesn't give — **(c′) truncation repair**.

## Glossary — every recurring term, in plain language

Read this whenever a term in the notes or in `main.tex` is unfamiliar. Each entry gives the intuition first, then the precise meaning, then where it shows up.

**Dead core.** The interior region where the solution $u$ is *exactly* zero. Physically: where the reactant has been completely consumed. It exists because the absorption $u^\gamma$ with $\gamma<1$ is non-Lipschitz at $0$.

**Branching point / free-boundary point.** A point $x_0$ on the edge of the dead core where $u$ touches zero *with* a horizontal tangent: $u(x_0)=0$ and $Du(x_0)=0$. These are the points at which the sharp growth estimate is proved. ("Free boundary" = the boundary $\partial\{u>0\}$, unknown in advance; "branching" because the two phases $\{u>0\}$ and $\{u<0\}$ can meet there.)

**Jet (1-jet, 2-jet).** The Taylor data of $u$ at a point. The **$k$-jet** is $(u(x_0),Du(x_0),\dots,D^k u(x_0))$. The **1-jet** $=(u(x_0),Du(x_0))$ is value + gradient (the best affine approximation). A **vanishing 1-jet** means $u(x_0)=|Du(x_0)|=0$ — exactly the branching-point condition. A **vanishing 2-jet** adds $|D^2u(x_0)|=0$ (Hessian zero too); this is the $\nu=2$ case, available only at $p=2$.

**$\nu$ (nu).** The order of vanishing assumed at the branching point: $\nu=1$ uses a vanishing 1-jet, $\nu=2$ a vanishing 2-jet. For $p\neq2$ only $\nu=1$ is usable (quadratics aren't $(s,p)$-harmonic).

**Fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta)^s$.** Nonlocal diffusion of order $2s$. $(-\Delta)^s u(x)=c_{n,s}\,\text{P.V.}\!\int \frac{u(x)-u(y)}{|x-y|^{n+2s}}dy$ — averages how $u(x)$ differs from $u$ everywhere else.

**Fractional $p$-Laplacian $(-\Delta_p)^s$.** The nonlinear ($p\neq2$) version: replace the difference $u(x)-u(y)$ by $J_p(u(x)-u(y))=|u(x)-u(y)|^{p-2}(u(x)-u(y))$. Reduces to $(-\Delta)^s$ when $p=2$.

**$s$-harmonic / $(s,p)$-harmonic.** A function with $(-\Delta)^s u=0$ (resp. $(-\Delta_p)^s u=0$) — the nonlocal analogue of "harmonic" ($\Delta u=0$). These are the "trivial" solutions the Liouville theorem classifies.

**P.V. (principal value).** A symmetric way to make sense of the singular integral defining the operator (the weight $|x-y|^{-n-2s}$ blows up at $y=x$); the odd part cancels, leaving a finite value.

**Tail / $L^1_s$ / $\mathrm{Tail}_{p-1,sp}$.** Bookkeeping for the far-field. Because the operator is nonlocal, it only makes sense if $u$ doesn't grow too fast at infinity. $\|u\|_{L^1_s}=\int\frac{|u(y)|}{1+|y|^{n+2s}}dy$ (the $p=2$ version); $\mathrm{Tail}_{p-1,sp}$ is its $p$-analogue. "Finite tail" = "far-field tame enough for the theory to work." Almost every difficulty in the project is a tail question.

**Seminorm $[u]_{C^\alpha}$, Hölder space $C^{k,\alpha}$.** Measures of smoothness. $[u]_{C^\alpha}=\sup_{x\neq y}\frac{|u(x)-u(y)|}{|x-y|^\alpha}$ quantifies $\alpha$-Hölder continuity; $C^{k,\alpha}=C^{k+\alpha}$ means $k$ derivatives, the $k$-th being $\alpha$-Hölder. $[u]_{C^{1+\alpha}}$ controls the gradient's Hölder norm.

**Viscosity solution.** A notion of solution needing no derivatives of $u$: test against smooth functions touching $u$ from above/below. Used because solutions may not be twice differentiable, and because it extends to nonlinear/$p$ operators.

**Weak solution.** The other notion of solution, defined by integrating against test functions ($u\in W^{s,p}$). For this problem weak $\equiv$ viscosity (Korvenpää–Kuusi–Lindgren).

**Blow-up / rescaling.** Zoom in at a branching point: $v_r(x)=u(rx)/r^\alpha$, study $r\to0$. The exponent $\alpha$ is chosen so the rescaled functions stay balanced; their limit $v_0$ is a clean model solution.

**Homogeneity (of the operator).** $(-\Delta_p)^s(\lambda u)=\lambda^{p-1}(-\Delta_p)^s u$ for $\lambda>0$ ($(p-1)$-homogeneity), and the order-$sp$ spatial scaling. In our project these two together make the absorption term vanish along the blow-up — *this replaces the differentiation step that needs linearity*.

**Liouville theorem.** "Entire solution + controlled growth $\Rightarrow$ trivial (a polynomial / zero)." The engine that classifies the blow-up limit $v_0$ and forces the contradiction. The project's "load-bearing wall."

**Increment / first difference $w^h$.** $w^h(x)=u(x+h)-u(x)$. Differencing lowers the growth order by one and, for $p\neq2$, turns the nonlinear equation into a *linear* one for $w^h$ (with a $u$-dependent kernel). **Second difference** $\Delta_h^2u=u(\cdot+2h)-2u(\cdot+h)+u(\cdot)$ lowers it by two.

**Cocycle identity.** The bookkeeping rule $w^{h_1+h_2}=w^{h_1}(\cdot+h_2)+w^{h_2}$ for increments; used to show a quantity depending on $h$ is linear in $h$.

**Stability lemma.** The theorem letting you pass an equation to the limit: if $u_k\to u$ (with global tail control) and $(-\Delta)^s u_k=f_k$, then $(-\Delta)^s u=\lim f_k$. The hypothesis that the convergence be *global* (in $L^1_s$) is the subtle one — the source of the §4 gap.

**$\theta_k$ device.** The contradiction machine (PTU §4 / CP §6): assume the estimate fails, build a sequence whose rescaled blow-up survives a normalization but must vanish by Liouville. $\theta_k(r')$ measures the worst seminorm growth across scales.

**Gradient anchor.** A trick ($\int\eta\,D_e v=\int D_e\eta\,v\le C$) that pins the gradient at one point, giving local bounds on $v_k$ *without* normalizing it in $L^\infty$ — useful nonlocally.

**Schauder estimate / "better than Schauder."** Schauder theory gives the generic a-priori regularity ($C^{2s+\gamma}$ for $p=2$). "Better than Schauder" = the growth at branching points is *smoother* than that generic ceiling — the whole point of the word "improved" in the title.

**Nondegeneracy.** Two uses. (1) Lower bound matching the growth: $\sup_{B_r}|u|\ge c\,r^\alpha$ (makes the estimate sharp). (2) For the $p\neq2$ Liouville: that the limit $v_0$ has $Dv_0\not\equiv0$ on open sets, so the increment's $v_0$-dependent kernel stays uniformly elliptic.

**Admissible region.** The set of parameters $(s,p,\gamma)$ for which the theorem's hypotheses hold simultaneously — the analogue of PTU's $\gamma\in(0,1/3),s\in(1/2,1)$. Determined by intersecting the constraint conditions (C1 tail, C2 the cap $\alpha<2$, etc.).
