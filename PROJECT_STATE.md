## 1. What this project is

Improved regularity for the **two-phase nonlocal dead-core problem**

$$(-\Delta_p)^s u = u_+^\gamma - u_-^\gamma \quad \text{in } B_1, \qquad 0<\gamma<p-1,\ s\in(0,1),\ p\ge 2.$$

Goal: at free boundary points $x_0$ with $u(x_0)=|Du(x_0)|=0$, prove
$|u(x)| \le C|x-x_0|^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha = \frac{sp}{p-1-\gamma}$ — *better* than the optimal regularity of $(s,p)$-harmonic functions ("better than Schauder").
Byproduct via $s \nearrow 1$: the two-phase **local** $p$-dead-core estimate $C|x-x_0|^{p/(p-1-\gamma)}$ — new even locally.

Strategy (supervisor, email 2026-04-26): transplant the PTU machine — Liouville-type theorem + known regularity. Local blueprint: Correa–dos Prazeres §6. The fact that $(p-1)$-homogeneity of $(-\Delta_p)^s$ replaces linearization is our new mechanism.

- **Supervisor: Rafayel Teymurazyan** — rafayel.teymurazyan@kaust.edu.sa, co-author of the template paper (PTU). Plan: bring §3–§5 of the notes to his office once Lemmas tail/beta/ceiling are verified.

## 5. The three pillar papers (PDFs in `papers/`)

1. **PTU** — dos Prazeres–Teymurazyan–Urbano, arXiv:2504.09557 — template ($p=2$): exponent $\frac{2s}{1-\gamma}$, range $\gamma\in(0,1/3)$, $s\in(1/2,1)$.
2. **Correa–dos Prazeres** — arXiv:2504.11370 — two-phase quenching (Alt–Phillips) for local $p$-Laplacian; **§6** = Liouville + regularity strategy in the quasilinear setting.
3. **Giovagnoli–Jesus–Silvestre** — arXiv:2509.26565 — $C^{1,\alpha}$ for fractional $p$-harmonic functions, $p\in[2,\frac{2}{1-s})$, with Tail term. **This is the $C^{1,\alpha_0}$ input for Lemma `lem:ceiling`.** ⚠️ Stated for homogeneous equation only — extension to RHS $f\in L^\infty$ must be checked.

## 6. Where we are (update every session)

**Done:**
- Repo + Overleaf pipeline operational; initial notes (`main.tex`) written: scaling exponent, homogeneity blow-up mechanism, three constraint lemmas (first pass), Liouville conjecture with routes (a)/(b), target theorems, reading list.
- $C^{1,\alpha_0}$ paper identified (GJS); supervisor's three pillars filed and referenced.

**Key open items (the critical path):**
1. **Liouville theorem** (Conjecture `conj:liouville`) — the load-bearing wall. Route (a) first: $C^{1,\alpha_0}$ estimate "modulo affine functions" (affine subtraction breaks the equation — that's the real obstruction). Read Correa–dos Prazeres §6 first.
2. **Verify Lemma `lem:tail`** — boxed condition $\gamma < \frac{(p-1)^2}{p-1+sp}$ is a FIRST PASS, must be recomputed (decide: incremental quotients needed or tail applies directly to $v_0$). Sanity: $p=2$ ⇒ $\gamma<\frac{1}{1+2s}$.
3. **GJS with RHS** — does their $C^{1,\alpha}$ survive $f\in L^\infty$?
4. Intersect the three constraint regions → hypothesis of the main theorem.
5. Stability lemma for $(-\Delta_p)^s$ under local uniform convergence (Brasco–Lindgren / KKL) — replaces Caffarelli–Silvestre Lemma 5.

**Questions ready for the supervisor meeting (prepared 2026-06-10):**
1. *Far-field tail in PTU §4:* (4.11) is justified only for $|x| \le \frac{1}{2r_k}$, but the limit passage (4.12) needs uniform $L^1_s$ control on all of $\mathbb{R}^n$; the outer region needs $\theta_k \gtrsim r_k^{-2s\gamma/(1-\gamma)}$. How is this handled? **Confirmed it cannot be waved away: CS Lemma 4.3 requires global $L^1(\omega)$ convergence and their Remark 4.4 gives a counterexample of exactly this far-field-mass type.** (Same issue is the one remaining gap in our $p\neq2$ tail analysis; the $p=2$ fix will be our fix.)
2. *The $s\nearrow1$ theorem:* GJS constants blow up as $s\to1$ (their §1.2, explicit) — propose proving the local two-phase theorem directly (CP §6 scheme + classical $C^{1,\alpha}$), possibly as a separate short paper.
3. *GJS with RHS:* propose writing the $f\in L^\infty$ extension in the range $p < \frac{1}{1-s}$ (their own remark suggests it works there; forces $s>\frac12$ like PTU) as a lemma of our paper.

**Major development (2026-06-10, end of session): proposed 5-step repair of PTU (4.12) at $p=2$** — main.tex, attack notes (c′): truncate increments; far-field datum has vanishing oscillation (iff $\gamma<\frac{1}{1+2s}$); divergent constant $a_k$ is bounded *a posteriori* by evaluating the equation; limit equation $(-\Delta)^s(v_0(\cdot+h)-v_0)=b\cdot h$; second differences kill $b$ and PTU's own Liouville finishes. **No lower bound on $\theta_k$ needed anywhere.** If it checks out: fixes the template paper AND removes the main obstacle for $p\neq2$ (where increments solve the linear $L_{K}$ equation with GJS's kernel; new constraint $\gamma<\frac{p-1}{1+sp}$).

**Next session: (1) check repair steps (1)–(5) on paper line by line; (2) bring to R.T. — agenda question 1 now comes WITH a proposed answer; (3) start the $p\neq2$ port via the linearized equation.**

## 7. Conventions and decisions already made

- Two-phase formulation is forced: one-phase signed dead cores obstructed nonlocally by the strong minimum principle (use in introduction).
- Notion of solution (first pass): weak, $u\in W^{s,p}_{loc}\cap L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)$; weak ≡ viscosity cited from Korvenpää–Kuusi–Lindgren; existence plumbing deferred.
- $\nu=2$ Liouville is out of reach (quadratics not $(s,p)$-harmonic) — remark, not a problem.
- Tail notation: $\mathrm{Tail}_{p-1,sp}$ as in Brasco–Lindgren–Schikorra.
- Macros in `main.tex`: `\fpl{u}`, `\Jp{t}`, `\al`, `\Tail`, `\TODO{}`, `\NOTE{}` — reuse, don't redefine.
